Project Introduction
A collateralized loan refers to a type of loan where the borrower provides collateral in the form of cryptocurrency or other digital assets to secure the loan. This approach leverages blockchain technology for secure and transparent transactions.

In this project, you will develop, deploy, and interact with a simple collateralized loan contract on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity. This contract will manage loans backed by Ethereum as collateral, offering hands-on experience with real-world financial smart contracts. Through this project, you'll gain a deeper understanding of how digital assets can be used to secure loans and how smart contracts autonomously manage and enforce the terms of these loans.
